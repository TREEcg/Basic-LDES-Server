# Basic LDES server

A Basic LDES is a 1 dimensional pagination of an event streamâ€™s full history and latest objects. The Basic LDES server can be used to map your back-end system to a Basic LDES HTTP server by implementing the Source class.

A Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) is a collection of immutable objects. The HTTP interface adheres to the [LDES specification](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification) by SEMIC. An LDES can be fragmented in different ways using the [TREE specification](https://w3id.org/tree/specification). Check the [TREE Linked Data Fragments website](https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org) for more background and implementations.
